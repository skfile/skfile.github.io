With the advent of 'nocode' platforms for building anything from a successful ecommerce business to a customized website, it is easier than ever to start a business. That is, it is easier than ever to take an idea and run with it, proverbially of course.

And this trend doesn't only lie in the new nocode technologies, but in the cross-platfrom development frameworks, and BAAS (backend as a service) providers. For those with a more technical background, these technologies, and more importantly, their free trials, can act as a catalyst for innovations.

So now it's the case that if it so easy to run with an idea, the only real oppertunity cost a prospective entrepeneur takes is time. And yes, I admit I am making the assumption that free trials are enough, which if you are crafty enough, is usually the case.

The question has changed from being "can I build this?" to "Is this worth my time?". And assuming you have the time, 9 out of 10 times a person would say yes to their own idea. That's great in a lot of ways. People have an outlet for ambition, creativity and overall exploration all from this change in a question.

But what remains is still a danger. The sitcom idea.

I first heard about sitcom ideas in innovation from [Paul Graham's blog](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html). And the way he explains a sitcom idea is so good I'll just show it here:

>"Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming up with good startup ideas is hard. It's not something you can do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually bad." [(Citation)](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)

The danger of a sitcom idea is the danger of wasted time. And given with every new idea most people have to learn a new framework, documentation, or something else; I speak from experience when I say that sitcom ideas are best avoided. So how do we avoid sitcom ideas?

My strategy is simple. Before you make a product, find a customer. Better yet, find 10 customers (and make sure the product is subscription based). Suffice to say, if you have an audience who you know will laugh, you will know at the end of the day that there will at least be 10 people whose day you made better.

A simple strategy, but by no means a simple implementation. As marketing is a completely underrated skill. I recommend email marketing, but that topic deserves a book, or at the minimum, a post devoted just to itself.
