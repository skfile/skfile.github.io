While I admit to being no expert on the subject, the sheer extent to which there still lies a capacity for innovation in this field leaves me so awestruck that I feel it best to make this my first post.

As it would likely take me a novel to show the true extent of possibilites in this feild, I would like to turn your attention to an aspect of nueroscience that current compuatational methods are perfectly suited to understanding. We currently know that the functioning of the human brain can be affected by our lifestyle and moreover, our diet. The main method by which this occurs lies not only in the nutrients that we get from out food, or lack thereof, but in how our diet and lifestyle impacts our microbiome.

This ecosystem which we rely upon for digestion, nutrients, immunity and our overall bodily functions acts, like most ecosystems,  as a graph. And this is where graphs and the current advancements in deep learning have the ability to combine perfectly.

Graph neural networks, in particular, can allow us to better understand what microbiota, or microorganisms, in the microbiome have the greatest impact on the ecosystem. However, while this problem of finding signficant microbiota is indeed important, this approach has the further capacity of allowing us to virtually test the impact of treatments like probiotics and prebiotics to tell us the likelyhood of a positive impact on the overall ecosystem.

The ability to virtually simulate a human ecosystem is not only a benefit for the problem of balancing an individuals microbiome, but a benefit that is arguably the goal of computational medicine in a nutshell.
